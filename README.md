# Snake-Game
Author: Ramses Cardenes

Using C#:
For this Snake Game, I created a new form so that the user should be
able to set the number of apples to any positive integer. Also, when the game is lost, 
the application must show a message declaring the number of eaten apples. 
When any of the three events EatAndGrow, HitWallAndLose, and HitSnakeAndLose is triggered, the event must be handled in the MainForm by playing a
different sound for each event. After every 10 eaten apples, the speed of snake should increase, and the maximum speed of
snake must is 10. I have a progress bar in my form to shoiw the current value of Step. All the red dots representing
apples blink. Finally, clicking g anywhere on the game field pause/resume the game.
